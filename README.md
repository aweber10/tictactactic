# TicTacTactic - Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe

A Progressive Web App implementation of Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe, a strategic and complex variant of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game.

## Game Modes

### Classic Ultimate Mode
- The board consists of a 3×3 grid of smaller Tic-Tac-Toe boards
- The first player can place their mark in any square on any of the small boards
- The position of a player's move within a small board determines which small board the next player must play in
- A player wins a small board by getting three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally)
- The player who wins three small boards in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the entire game
- If a player is sent to a board that is already won or full, they can place their mark on any open square on any board

### Meta-Duell Hardcore Mode
- A strategic meta-layer where multiple Ultimate games are organized in a 3×3 grid
- Each position in the meta-grid represents a full Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe game
- The position of the last won sub-game determines which Ultimate game must be played next
- Players can navigate between the meta-board and any Ultimate game to observe the state of play
- A player wins the Meta-Duell by winning three Ultimate games in a row on the meta-board
- If directed to an already completed Ultimate game, the player may choose any available game
